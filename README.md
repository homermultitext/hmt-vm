# hmt-vm

This is the repository for the virtual machine the HMT project used in 2014, and is no longer active.  It has been superseded
by the updated VM used in the 2015 summer seminar. See the web page for the new VM at
<http://homermultitext.github.io/vm2015/>.

Because the first release of the new VM `vm2015` is strictly limited to functionality needed for creating HMT editions,
the 2014 VM had some material for analytical work that will be folded into a later second release of `vm2015`,
this repository is not yet being deleted. It will be when `vm2015` includes all the material in the 2014 VM.
